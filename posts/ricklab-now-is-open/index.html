Mind has no matter or energy but they can&rsquo;t escape its predominance over everything they do. Logic exists in the mind. numbers exist only in the mind. I don&rsquo;t get upset when scientists say that ghosts exist in the mind. it&rsquo;s that only that gets me. science is only in your mind too, it&rsquo;s just that that doesn&rsquo;t make it bad. or ghosts either."
Laws of nature are human inventions, like ghosts. Law of logic, of mathematics are also human inventions, like ghosts."
&mldr;we see what we see because these ghosts show it to us, ghosts of Moses and Christ and the Buddha, and Plato, and Descartes, and Rousseau and Jefferson and Lincoln, on and on and on. Isaac Newton is a very good ghost. One of the best. Your common sense is nothing more than the voices of thousands and thousands of these ghosts from the past.”
